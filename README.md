# random_walks_coloring

A program in JavaScript using p5.js written by alamius in 2017.
It is using Points that (with every frame) choose 
  a laplace-random drection and 
  a laplace-random distance to move in that direction.
The Points can be collected in "Point centers" to give them their own settings.
